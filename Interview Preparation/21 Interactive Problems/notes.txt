Interacting with the judge:
    1. When we print output on the console/ screen, it is an expensive process.
    2. Languages try to store the output in the output buffer.
    3. Once the program terminates, then all the output is printed in one go.

When interacting with the judge, once you print the output (it will act as input for the judge), you will receive an input from the judge.

Hence, we cannot print all the output in one go, we use flushing commands.
After printing, we flush the buffer on the screen ie.we tell the program, not to store the output in buffer.

To flush the output:
    fflush(stdout); (if using printf, scanf)
    cout << flush; (if using cin, cout)
    System.out.flush() in JAVA
    stdout.flush() in Python
