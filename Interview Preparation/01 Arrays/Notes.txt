- for smallest element initialize it with + inf.
- for largest element initialize it with - inf.
- to represent inf in C++ use <climits>
    macro : INT_MAX for smallest, INT_MIN for largest

- max subarray sum.
    1) Naive approach : O(n^3)
        1) generate all the subarrays and their sums.
        2) finding the largest of n sums.

    2) Cumulative sum : O(n^2)
        // we have eliminated the loop to calculate the sum.
        1) precompute the sums.
        2) make cumulative sum array.
            // sum till the last and add the current one.
            // this array can be built in linear time.
            csum[i] = csum[i - 1] + arr[i];
            
        3) we are basically finding the sum of subarray from index i to j:
            sum(arr(i, j)) = csum[j] - csum[i - 1];
