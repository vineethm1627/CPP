- for smallest element initialize it with + inf.
- for largest element initialize it with - inf.
- to represent inf in C++ use <climits>
    macro : INT_MAX for smallest, INT_MIN for largest

- max subarray sum.
    Naive approach : O(n^3)
        1) generate all the subarrays and their sums.
        2) finding the largest of n sums.
