Brainteaser - Daughter's ages

Local professors Dr X and Dr Y bump in to each other after a long time.

X: Hey! How have you been ?
Y: Great! I got married and I have 3 daughters now

X: Really? How old are they ?
Y: Well, the product of their ages is 72 and the sum of their ages is the same as the
   number on that building over there.

X: Right. Ok...oh wait...hmm, I still don't know.
Y: Oh Sorry, the oldest one just learnt to play piano. (hint!)

X: Wonderful, my oldest is the same age!

Question: How old are the daughters ?


Solution:
    x.y.z = 72
    x + y + z = no. on building

    {1, 1, 72}, {2, 9, 4}, {3, 6, 4}, {4, 2, 9}....
    all of these triplets have a unique sum except 2 triplets
    {6, 6, 2}, {8, 3, 3} --> both have sum = 14

    and 14 is the number on the building
    Hence X got confused.
    Oldest one plays piano ie. there is only one daughter who is the oldest

    Correct ans = {8, 3, 3}
