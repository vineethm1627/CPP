if(n & 1) {
    cout << "The number is odd";
}
else {
    cout << "It is even";
}

num & 1 = 1 if num is odd else it will be equal to 1

& is a bitwise operator.
it just checks the last bit ie. LSB(righmost bit).

example:

if num = 10 --> binary(10) --> 1010 & 1 --> 0.1 = 0 --> hence even
if num = 5 --> binary(5) --> 101 & 1 --> 1.1 = 1 --> hence odd

Logic :

& is a bitwise operator so if you provide a decimal number, it will convert it into binary and will then perform 
the operation.

notation in binary :  ....16 8 4 2 1
except 1 rest all the numbers are powers of 2 and hence even.
sum of even numbers is always even.
so all the odd numbers must have their LSB as 1 in binary notation.
