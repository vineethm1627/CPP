List in STL corresponds to doubly linked list.
Here, we have two pointers ie head and tail.

Forward List corresponds to singly linked list.
It uses one pointer ie head which points to the starting node.

Why Lists are useful ?
    insertion and deletion of data from front, middle or anywhere.
    these operations work in O(1)
    in vector if you have to enter an element in the middle then you need to shift all the elements after that position.

    some common operations:
        1) push_back : Insert at the tail
        2) push_front : Insert at the head
        3) pop_back : remove the element at the tail.
        4) pop_front : remove the element at the head.
        5) insert : 
        6) erase : based on index
        7) remove : to remove all occurences of a node value.
