- find function is used to find the address of the first occurence of the element.
- binary_search function is only used when the array is sorted.
- binary_search function will return a bool value stating whether
the element is present or not.
- lower_bound and upper_bound could be used to find the frequency of the element if present.
- by default the sort function sorts the array in ascending order.
- sort(arr, arr + n, compare)
- sort also takes a comparator function as a parameter.
- comparator function tells the sort function on what basis to sort. (based on no. of digits / first character etc.)
- this sort function now becomes very powerful as we now can do sorting based on custom conditions.

- rotate(); to rotate the elements of a container about the middle element.
- next_permutation(); lexographically next permutation of the elements.
  ex: 1 2 3 --> next_permutation --> 1 3 2 --> next_permutation --> 2 1 3.
