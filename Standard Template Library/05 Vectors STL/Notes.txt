- Vectors are dynamic arrays --> grow and shrink in size automatically depending upon the requirements.

- once the full size is reached, the size gets doubled.
- obviously there is a certain limit to how large the vector can grow in size.
- we are not worried about how much memory to allocate.

- Header file : #include <vector>
- vector is basically a class, and while initialization you need to specify the data type.
- vectors are homogeneous.

- iterator over vector --> vector<int>::iterator else simply use auto
- Doubling of memory is an expensive operation
