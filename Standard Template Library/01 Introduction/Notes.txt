What is STL ?

- set of classes and functions
- vector<pair<int, string>> ... fancy looking codes in CP
- provides a lot of inbuilt data structures and algorithms
- Major components :
    1) algorithms --> logic
    2) containers --> to store the data
    3) iterators and functors --> iterate over different buckets inside container.
functor is a functional object --> covered in priority queue section

Why to learn STL ?

- easy to use
- saves implementation time
- passes all the test cases
- optimized implementations
ex :  for n < 10 sort may use bubble sort
      for n >= 10 sort may use quick sort
- reusability of code.
